# Stereo Depth Estimation Used Verilog/SystemVerilog



## üîç Project Description
This project is a hardware implementation that utilizes two cameras to calculate depth values and represent them as Bitmaps on a monitor through VGA. The project is developed using Verilog and SystemVerilog, popular hardware description languages.



## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Dual Camera Utilization**: The system uses two cameras to capture depth information.
- **Depth Calculation**: Implements algorithms to calculate depth values based on the input from the two cameras.
- **Bitmap Representation**: Visualizes the calculated depth values as Bitmap images on a monitor.
- **VGA Output**: The Bitmap images are displayed on a monitor via VGA.
- **Verilog/SystemVerilog Implementation**: The entire system is implemented using Verilog and SystemVerilog.



## üõ† Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone {github repository url}
```
2. Install Verilog/SystemVerilog on your system. If you are using Ubuntu, you can install Icarus Verilog using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install iverilog
```
3. Navigate to the project directory and compile the Verilog/SystemVerilog files:
```bash
iverilog -o output_file source_file.v
```
4. Run the compiled output file:
```bash
vvp output_file
```



## üß™ How to Contribute
1. Fork the project.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.



## üéâ Acknowledgments
A big thank you to all contributors and the open-source community for making this project possible. Special thanks to the hardware description language community for their continuous support and resources.
